  <h1>Privacy Policy – SacraChat App</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 26, 2025</p>

<p>SacraChat (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) values your privacy and is committed to being transparent about how your information is collected, used, and stored. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>SacraChat collects information through the <strong>Memory System</strong> and user feedback:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Memory System:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The app scans your messages to identify personal information such as your name, age, hobbies, and other details you voluntarily share.</li>
      <li>This information is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and is never sold or shared with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
      <li>Memories may be used to personalize your experience and responses from AI. You can manage and delete these memories at any time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Feedback via Discord:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Messages you submit for feedback purposes are sent to our Discord server.</li>
      <li>Feedback is used to improve the app and its functionality.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell this information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Use of AI Services</h2>
<p>SacraChat uses two AI services depending on the settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magisterium Insights Mode (On):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses the <strong>Magisterium AI API</strong> for theological or Catholic faith-based questions.</li>
      <li>Responses are generated in accordance with Magisterium AI’s privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>General Mode / Magisterium Insights Mode (Off):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses the <strong>OpenAI API</strong> for general knowledge, homework help, and other non-theological topics.</li>
      <li>Responses follow OpenAI’s privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Memory System always interacts with the OpenAI API to personalize responses, even when Magisterium Insights is enabled.</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All <strong>settings and memories</strong> are stored locally on your device.</li>
  <li>Information is only sent to the respective AI API for generating responses.</li>
  <li>SacraChat does <strong>not sell your data</strong> to third parties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. User Control</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can <strong>view and delete memories</strong> in the app at any time.</li>
  <li>You can <strong>toggle Magisterium Insights on or off</strong> in settings.</li>
  <li>You can stop sending feedback via Discord at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to ensure your data is safe. While stored locally and transmitted securely to AI services, we cannot guarantee absolute security of data transmitted over the internet.</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>SacraChat is intended for teens and young users. If you are under 13 (or the age required by your local law), please ensure you have parental consent before using the app.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy occasionally to reflect improvements to the app or legal requirements. Users will be notified of significant changes.</p>

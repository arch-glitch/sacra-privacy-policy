<h1>Privacy Policy – Sacra App</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 22, 2025</p>

<p>Sacra (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) respects your privacy and is committed to transparency about how your information is collected, used, and stored. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Sacra collects information only as necessary to provide personalized experiences and allow feedback:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Memories:</b> Your messages may be analyzed locally using the OpenAI API to detect content for memory storage. All memories are stored <b>locally on your device</b>. You can view and delete memories at any time in settings. We do not store your messages on our servers.</li>
  <li><b>Feedback Reporting:</b> If you report a message using the thumbs up or down button, the message text (without any identifying information or metadata) is sent to a private Discord server for review. This data is anonymous and used only to improve the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Voice Input</h2>
<p>Sacra supports voice input via your device’s built-in dictation features. This occurs <b>only when you tap the voice dictation button</b>. We <b>do not</b> have access to your voice or audio data. All transcription is handled by your device according to Apple’s privacy rules.</p>

<h2>3. Use of AI Services</h2>
<ul>
  <li>OpenAI API is used for:
    <ul>
      <li>Recognizing when to add memories.</li>
      <li>Generating chatbot responses.</li>
      <li>Naming conversations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All data sent to OpenAI is text-only, and their own <a href="https://openai.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a> governs retention and use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All memories, conversations, and settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
  <li>We <b>do not</b> store any messages, voice data, or personal information in the cloud.</li>
  <li>Feedback messages sent via Discord are anonymous and stored on a private server accessible only to the developer and Discord.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. User Control</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can view or delete all memories at any time in the app.</li>
  <li>You can stop sending feedback via the thumbs up/down button at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your local data. While data is transmitted securely to the OpenAI API and Discord for limited purposes, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Sacra is intended for teens and young users. If you are under 13 (or the age required by local law), please obtain parental consent before using the app. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age.</p>

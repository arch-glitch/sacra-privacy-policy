  <h1>SacraChat Privacy Policy</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      This privacy policy explains how SacraChat (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the SacraChat iOS app.
    </p>

    <strong>Information Collection:</strong>
    <p>
      SacraChat collects the text prompts you enter in the app to generate AI responses and any reports you submit via the “report message” feature. 
      We do not collect names, email addresses, device IDs, locations, or other personal information.
    </p>

    <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong>
    <p>
      - <strong>OpenAI:</strong> Your prompts are sent to OpenAI to generate AI responses. OpenAI may temporarily process and store data according to its policies.<br>
      - <strong>Discord:</strong> Reported messages are sent via webhook to Discord for moderation and customer support purposes. These are not used for advertising, tracking, or analytics.
    </p>

    <strong>Use of Data:</strong>
    <p>
      Data is used solely to provide app functionality and support. It is <b>not</b> used for tracking, advertising, analytics, or personalization.
    </p>

    <strong>Data Retention:</strong>
    <p>
      SacraChat does not store user prompts or reports. Third-party services (OpenAI, Discord) may retain data temporarily as outlined in their own privacy policies.
